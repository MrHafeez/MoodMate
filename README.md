# MoodMate: Real-time Emotion Recognition System

MoodMate is an advanced emotion recognition system that utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and classify human emotions in real-time. This project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to analyze facial expressions and provide instant feedback on the emotional state of individuals.

## Key Features

- Real-time emotion detection from live video feed
- Support for 7 basic emotions: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Surprised, and Disgusted
- Utilizes the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset for training
- Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate emotion classification
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Technical Details

- Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras
- Uses haar cascade for face detection
- Employs a custom CNN architecture for emotion classification
- Achieves high accuracy in real-world scenarios

## Applications

- Mental health monitoring
- Customer sentiment analysis
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research
- Educational tools for emotional intelligence

MoodMate aims to bridge the gap between human emotions and digital understanding, opening up new possibilities in fields ranging from psychology to artificial intelligence.
